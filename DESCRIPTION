Description: A straightforward model to estimate soil migration rates across various soil contexts. 
	Based on the compartmental, vertically-resolved, physically-based mass balance model of Soto and Navas (2004) 
	<doi:10.1016/j.jaridenv.2004.02.003> and Soto and Navas (2008) <doi:10.1016/j.radmeas.2008.02.024>.
	'RadEro' provides a user-friendly interface in R, utilizing input data such as 137Cs inventories and parameters directly derived 
	from soil samples (e.g., fine fraction density, effective volume) to accurately capture the 137Cs distribution within the soil profile. 
	The model simulates annual 137Cs fallout, radioactive decay, and vertical diffusion, with the diffusion coefficient calculated 
	from 137Cs reference inventory profiles. Additionally, it allows users to input custom parameters as calibration coefficients. 
	This tool and its code are openly accessible, facilitating usage in soil erosion studies.
